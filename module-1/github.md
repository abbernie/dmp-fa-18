## Putting your sketch on the web with GitHub Pages

GitHub has some perks. One is that it can host our p5 sketches on the web!

* In the GitHub App, open your personal repository for this class.
* On the top bar, find the branch icon:

   ![github branch icon](images/git-branch-512.png)

* Create a new branch that is called `gh-pages`. It **must** be called `gh-pages`, no other name will do.
* Click Publish in the top righthand corner of the app
* GitHub will automatically turn your `gh-pages` branch into a hosted website.
* Your sketch is now online at: `http://yourusername.github.io/reponame/foldername/`
* In class we will walk through replacing each of the parts of that URL with your specific username, repo name, and sketch path.
