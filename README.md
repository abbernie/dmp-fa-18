# DA 615 Digital Media Programming, Fall 2018
### Goucher College MA in Digital Arts / MFA in Art & Technology


# Intro to p5.js and 2d primitives

In this class, you will work with [p5.js](http://p5js.org), a JavaScript toolkit for coding digital art, based on the [Processing](http://processing.org) programming environment.

p5.js is remarkable because it runs *right in your web browser*. Through p5, you will learn the conventions of JavaScript, one of the core languages of the web and one of the most common languages used by developers today.


## Context: Creative Code

[*Artist and Computer* (1975)](http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/) lays out a vision for a "scientific aesthetic" in which hybrid artist-engineers explore computer programming as an expressive medium.

[Design by Numbers](https://vimeo.com/72611093), created by John Maeda in the late 1990s, was one of the first programming languages designed specifically for artists. Through Maeda's research group at MIT, Design By Numbers evolved into Processing, the inspiration for p5.js.

[*Process 4* by Casey Reas](http://thecreatorsproject-images.vice.com/videos/images/000/000/164/caseyreas_original.jpg?1xw:0.48xh;*,*&resize=1200:*) is an artwork generated by a computer algorithm. It's clear, however, that the human hands guiding the algorithm play a significant role in the work. The artist has broad control over the artwork, enough--it seems to me--to qualify this program as a personal expression (we'll recreate this artwork in class).

In [this performance](http://medias.ircam.fr/x6b4e2d), Kyle Stetz performs music by live coding JavaScript on stage. In music, often considered an art of emotion, performances like this seem to be the final obliteration of the notion that computer programming is a cold, objective or purely scientific act.
